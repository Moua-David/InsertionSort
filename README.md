# InsertionSort
command line program demonstrating the insertion sort

## Description
Sometimes it is difficult to vizualize how sorting algorithms work. This program creates a random array of integers with user-defined array length, and color the sorted area on the left to show how the algorithm inserts the next value from the unsorted area on the right into the sorted area.
